# Installing BepInEx

BepInEx is a utility that allows your mods to work. That's all you need to know!

First, Download BepInEx **[here](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases)**.

> Which version do I download? 

If you use Unix, I can't really give directions here as I've never used it. But if you have Windows, you'll want to verify your OS type. If you're not sure, [go here](https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/which-version-of-windows-operating-system-am-i-running-628bec99-476a-2c13-5296-9dd081cdd808) and follow the instructions to verify. If you have a 64-bit system, get the x64 file.

Once you've downloaded one of the release files, open the zip file, and put its contents in your Streets of Rogue directory.

By default, this is at `C:\Program Files\Steam\SteamApps\common\StreetsOfRogue`

Once that's done, you'll do an initial setup. Run Streets of Rogue. Get to the title screen, and just close the program. Among other things, this will create a new folder inside BepInEx folder called `Plugins`. Verify that it's in there.

If all of the above was done correctly, you will now be able to throw a mod's DLL file into StreetsOfRogue/BepInEx/Plugins. It will automatically be loaded when you run Streets of Rogue.

# The Unity Networking Fix

Put [this Unity DLL file](/Hosted/UnityEngine.Networking.dll) in `/Streets of Rogue/StreetsOfRogue_Data/Managed`.
