#	Traits

##		Underdank Traits
The Underdank is a sewer network that includes all opened Manholes, and Toilets if you're small enough to fit through them.

- Both traits cause Manholes to spawn in all districts. 
- Activate an Underdank access point to teleport to another one.
- If no exit exists (not counting your entry point), one of the following will happen. Both inflict damage that can be prevented by wearing a helmet.
  - The water will push you headfirst out a closed Manhole. 
  - The water will push you (too large) through a Toilet and destroy it in the process.
- There is a chance to Shitsplode any access point you exit. This poisons you and anyone nearby, possibly angering them.
